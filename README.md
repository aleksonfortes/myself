Hello!

This is my READ.ME, I have taken inspiration for this document from various references found on the internet (see references). This read me is a convenient way to introduce myself and how I like to work.

The intended audience is primarily anyone who works with me, although anyone is free to read and provide feedback. Please treat it as a reference on how I will conduct myself when working together.

`Disclaimer: This document applies to my personal work style, and is not official company policy`

## What I can offer to my team, my leader, and to the company I work for:

If I describe myself, it is:

- My leader listens to what I have to say
- My leader trusts me and my skills
- My leader does not practice micro management
- My leader helps me to create space for learning and growing in my career
- My leader gives me feedback and 1:1 time

## Feedback

- I'm totally open to receiving any kind of feedback and appreciate when I get it. I consider feedback as a way to improve myself and you can feel free to tell me anything you want. Also, you don't need to apply any kind of feedback technique, just say what you would like and I won't be offended.
- In terms of giving feedback, I wait for people to ask for it or to show me that they are open to receive, unless it is really necessary to give the feedback.
- Also, I am aware that I cannot expect others to like to receive feedback as I do, so I try to be as much respectful as I can when giving feedback.
